The importance of git and github is it gives us the power to review or even restore
earlier version unlike to other software, Both Git and GitHub give programmers valuable
version-control functionality so that they can build ongoing coding projects without being
afraid of messing everything up. GitHub expands upon Gitâ€™s basic functionality. It presents
an extremely intuitive, graphically represented user interface, and provides programmers
with built-in control and task-management tools. Through GitHub, you can share your code
with others, giving them the power to make revisions or edits on your various Git branches.
This makes it possible for entire teams to coordinate together on single projects in
real-time.
